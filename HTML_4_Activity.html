            <p>Hi my name is Ishi, I am a senior at NCSU with a major in Nutrition Science. My goal for this class is to successfully land a software developer/engineering job at a company for now. I hope to soon be able to work at my dream company GOOGLGE. I do also want to be able to get my own dog, espcially a Corgi if you haven't figured it out by my image XD.</p>
